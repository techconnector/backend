# TechConnector Social Network Backend

This is the backend server for a simple Social Network project for the Tech Community. It's built on top of the [AdonisJS Framework](https://adonisjs.com) using good development practices such as _Object-Oriented Programming_, _MVC_, _Dependency Injection_, _Factories_, _Migrations_, _Database Seeds_ and much more.

## Installation

Creates your project's root folder and then via the _CMD_ or _Terminal_ access the newly created folder and run the command to clone the server from the [github repository](https://github.com/techconnector/backend):

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/techconnector/backend.git
```

After downloading the source code for the server; go inside the **server folder** via the _CMD_ or _Terminal_ and run the following command, to install all the project's dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

In order to have an easy way to execute the server, generate new **models**, **controllers**, **seeds**, **migrations**, **executes tests**, etc. You need to install a global package for the [AdonisJS Framework CLI](https://github.com/adonisjs/adonis-cli). You can install it using the following:

```bash
$ npm i -g @adonisjs/cli
```

## Documentation

The **Server API endpoints** documentation are provided inside the project itself, so to access the documentation you need first to execute the Installation process as previously described and then access the **server folder** via the _CMD_ or _Terminal_ and run:

```bash
$ adonis serve --dev
```

After running the previous command you can access the following URL http://localhost:3333/docs and it will provide all the available API endpoints
